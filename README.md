# Skin Type Detection and Recommendation Web App

## Description
Skin Type Detection and Recommendation is an AI-powered web app designed to help users determine their skin type and receive personalized skincare recommendations. The app offers two methods for skin type analysis:

1. Image Analysis: Users can upload their facial images, and the app will use machine learning models to classify their skin type.

2. Questionnaire: For those who prefer not to upload images, the app provides a series of questions to determine their skin type based on responses.

Once the skin type is detected, the app offers customized skincare tips and product recommendations to help users take better care of their skin.

## Features
- Skin Type Detection using AI and image analysis.

- Questionnaire-based Skin Type Classification for users who prefer not to upload images.

- Personalized Skincare Recommendations based on the detected skin type.

- User-friendly Web Interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, Keras (for skin type detection)
- Database: MongoDB (for storing user preferences and recommendations)
- Deployment: vercel
