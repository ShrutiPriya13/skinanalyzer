The dataset includes 3626 images.
Skin are annotated in Multi-Class Classification format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -6 and +6 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -3 and +3 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.77 percent of pixels
